STEPS
1) Have the NodeJS server render views/index.ejs that has the html content for the client whenever the client requests "/".

    routings/index.js

    app.get("/", function(req, res){
      res.render('index', {});
    });

2) In the client codes, have a javascript code that asks the user for their name and store this user input in a variable called name.

3) Have the client EMIT "got_a_new_user" and pass "name" to the server.

4)Have the server LISTEN for an event called 'got_a_new_user' and when that event gets triggered,
  A) have the server BROADCAST AN EVENT called "new_user" to the clients with the name of this new user attached to this event,
  B) we store the name/session_id of the new user in a variable/array/hash called users,
  C) to the person who sent this request we EMIT an event called 'existing_users' with all the users data.

5) Have the client LISTEN for an event called 'new_user' and when this event gets triggered, have the client render this information in jQuery somewhere in the HTML.

6) Have the server listen for an event called 'disconnect'(when people disconnect) and when this occurs, BROADCAST to all the clients an event 'disconnected_user' with some data (maybe the name of the disconnected user)(NOTE: we will probably need to pass sessionID or something else to identify a user)

7) Have the client listen for an event 'disconnected_user' and when this gets triggered, have the client remove the proper jQuery box.
